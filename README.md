# Decision-Tree-Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for a custom Decision Tree Classifier and a comparison with scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier. Running the code will start the evaluation of the models, it will automatically choose the best one, it will evaluate the best model on un unseen test set and measure the time it takes to learn the tree, at last it uses the scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier and tests it on the same test set. 

## Code Files
- `decision_tree.py`: Main Python script for the custom Decision Tree Classifier.
- `wine_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (only for the scikit-learn comparison)
